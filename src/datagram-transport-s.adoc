= Datagram Transport
2016-02-06

== Introduction (Informative)

This standard defines the protocol for transporting OpenLCB datagrams.

== Intended Use (Informative)

The datagram transport protocol is intended to efficiently transfer
small amounts (0-72 bytes) of data reliably between two OpenLCB nodes.
It allows for management of overlapping independent transmissions.

The datagram transport protocol relies on the underlying OpenLCB message
transport protocol for reliable sequenced communications.

This document describes the required message formats for datagram
transport. Section 4 gives an overview of the message types with an
abstract numeric description intended as a normative guide to the
construction of concrete message types over specific physical transport
media. Section 7 describes, in concrete detail, the implementation of
the datagram transport message formats for the specific physical
transport media that have been adopted as normative standards.

== References and Context (Normative)

This is in the context of the following OpenLCB Standards:

* The OpenLCB Message Network Standard, which defines the basic messages
and how they interact. Higher-level protocols are based on this message
network, but are defined elsewhere. The Message Network Standard defines
the global error codes which are referenced here.
* The OpenLCB CAN Frame Transfer Standard, which specifies the use and
format of CAN frames for OpenLCB communications.

== Message Formats (Normative)

In the following, the “Common MTI” column specifies the the MTI value to
be used when communicating in OpenLCB common format. The Common MTI is
an abstract numeric description intended as a normative guide to the
construction of concrete message formats over specific physical
transport media.

=== Datagram Content

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|Name |Simple Node |Dest ID |Event ID |Common MTI |Data Content
|Datagram Content |N |Y |N |0x1C48 |0-72 bytes
|===

The first byte of the data content defines the datagram type and is
designated the Datagram Content ID. The values for that byte are
documented in the Standard for the protocol that defines the type.

=== Datagram Received OK

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|Name |Simple Node |Dest ID |Event ID |Common MTI |Data Content
|Datagram Received OK |N |Y |N |0x0A28 |Flags (1 byte)
|===

The flag bits are defined as:

* MSB 0x80 – Reply Pending – Use is defined by higher-level protocols.
* Low four bits 0x0F – Timeout Value – Zero indicates no timeout value.
A value N of 0x01 through 0x0F indicates that the pending reply will be
transmitted before 2^N^ seconds have elapsed; if not, an error has
occurred.
* All others are reserved, shall be sent as zero and ignored upon
receipt.

Datagram Received OK messages without a Flags byte shall be treated as
if they contained a byte with a zero value.

=== Datagram Rejected

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|Name |Simple Node |Dest ID |Event ID |Common MTI |Data Content
|Datagram Rejected |N |Y |N |0x0A48 |Error Code, optional info
|===

The data contents are, in order:

* Two bytes of error code.
* Any extra bytes that the node wishes to include. There can be zero or
more of these, to a maximum of 64 bytes. These shall be described in the
node documentation.

Nodes shall accept and process Datagram Rejected messages that do not
contain the full error code. Missing error code bits are to be
interpreted as zero.

==== Error Code

The Error Code field shall be in accordance with the Message Network
Standard.

== States (Normative)

The common OpenLCB datagram protocol has no formal states.

== Interactions (Normative)

A node that receives a valid Datagram Content message shall send either
a Datagram Received OK or Datagram Rejected message in reply. A node
that receives a Datagram Content message that does not comply with this
Standard may, but is not required to, reply with a Datagram Rejected
message.

=== Normal Transmission

Normal transmission consists of the transmitting node sending a Datagram
Content message to the receiving node, followed by the receiving node
sending a Datagram Received OK message to the transmitting node. A node
shall not send a send a second Datagram to the same receiving node
before receiving a reply from the receiving node or a timeout occurs.

=== Rejected Transmission

After the transmitting node sends a Datagram Content message to the
receiving node, the receiving node may send a Datagram Rejected message
to the transmitting node.

Upon receipt of a Datagram Rejected message with a Temporary Error, the
original transmitting node may resend the same Datagram Content message,
or may abandon the transmission attempt.

Upon receipt of a Datagram Rejected message with a Permanent Error, the
original transmitting node shall abandon the transmission attempt and
not resend the original Datagram Content message.

== Adaptation to CAN Transport (Normative)

This section describes the CAN implementation of the datagram transport
message formats.

=== CAN Message Formats

The OpenLCB CAN Frame Transport Standard and OpenLCB Message Network
Standard define how OpenLCB messages are carried across CAN networks.
Following those standards, the Datagram Transport messages used on CAN
are as defined in the following table.

|Datagram Content |0xdddfootnote:[ddd – The 12-bit destination alias
field] a|
0x1Add,dsssfootnote:[sss – The 12-bit source alias field ] –

larger than 8 bytes must be broken up among multiple messages. Thus,
four distinct message types are defined to aid in flow control.]

0x1Cdd,dsss – Middle

0x1Ddd,dsss – Last

destination Alias. See the OpenLCB-CAN Frame Transport Standard.], Flags

|Datagram Rejected |0xA48 |0x19A4,8sss |0xfddd, Error Code
|===

=== CAN States

A node implementing the OpenLCB-CAN datagram protocol shall maintain a
Datagram-started state for each datagram that it is receiving as a
sequence of frames. If the node receives multiple overlapping datagrams
from different source nodes, the states shall be independent.

=== CAN Interactions

==== Normal Transmission

Normal transmission of a datagram over CAN consists of the transmitting
node sending the Datagram Content message using one of two sequences of
Datagram frames:

* One Datagram Content Single Frame
* One Datagram Content First Frame, followed by zero or more Datagram
Content Middle Frame, followed by one Datagram Content Last Frame

A node shall not transmit frames with lower CAN priority between the
frames making up a datagram. A node may, but is not required to,
transmit frames with higher CAN priority between the frames making up a
datagram.

A receiving node receiving either of the above sequences shall send
either a Datagram Received OK or Datagram Rejected message in reply.

==== Rejected Transmission

If a receiving node receives a sequence of Datagram frames other than
one of

* One Datagram Content Single Frame
* One Datagram Content First Frame, followed by zero or more Datagram
Content Middle Frame, followed by one Datagram Content Last
Framefootnote:[The total payload bytes sent, including any First,
Middle, and Last Frames, cannot exceed 72 bytes.]

the receiving node shall send a Datagram Rejected message with a
Temporary Error, indicating a resend is allowed.
